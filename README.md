# Family_Trees

I wanted to be able to look up my big-little lineage without having to rely on oral tradition, which only goes back five years.
That desire (and too much time on my hands over break) gave birth to this family tree framework.
Also, this code now exists on a separate website as well, so that others in my organizations can look up their lineage.
